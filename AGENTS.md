# AGENTS.md — Rules for AI Assistants

Project: **word-mcp** (High-Performance Word .docx MCP Server • PyPI: `luiccian-word-mcp`).

---

## 0. Language, Aesthetics & Documentation Policy

- **Repository Language:** All official repository documentation, code comments, pull requests, issue templates, workflows, and git commits **MUST** be written in **Technical English**.
- **User Interaction:** When interacting with the user, the assistant should reply in **Spanish** (or the user's preferred language) while preserving technical names in English and maintaining a formal engineering tone.
- **Strict Aesthetic Standard (Zero Informal Emojis):** Prohibit informal emojis (such as rockets, party poppers, fire, tool icons) in markdown documentation, section headers, release notes, issue templates, and commit messages. Maintain a sober engineering format utilizing markdown tables and GitHub alerts (`> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`, `> [!WARNING]`).

---

## 1. Zero-Install Tier 1 Priority

When assisting users or configuring clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, Copilot), assistants must adhere to the following priority tiers:

- **Tier 1 (Recommended — Zero-Install):** Prioritize direct execution with `uvx luiccian-word-mcp`. Users do not need to clone the repository or manually manage Python virtual environments.
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "word-mcp": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["luiccian-word-mcp"],
        "env": {
          "MCP_ALLOWED_DIRECTORIES": "/path/to/documents"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- **Tier 2 (Advanced / Local Development):** For contributors developing features or modifying tools locally, use Astral `uv`:
  ```bash
  uv sync --all-groups
  uv run luiccian-word-mcp
  ```

---

## 2. Single-Pass Token Optimization Directive

- **Prohibition of Chatty Micro-Iterations:** AI assistants using `word-mcp` must avoid making consecutive micro-calls (e.g., calling `create_document`, then 15 separate calls to `add_heading`, `add_paragraph`, `add_table`, `set_page_numbering`, and `save_document`). This legacy anti-pattern consumes tens of thousands of tokens and multiple conversational turns.
- **Mandatory Single-Pass Usage:** Always prefer:
  1. `word_build_document`: Construct complete, publication-ready documents with headers, footers, page numbers (`PAGE`), margins, typography presets (`modern`, `formal`, `academic`, `compact`), headings, markdown styling, tables, and lists in **one single MCP tool call** (>90% token savings).
  2. `word_create_from_markdown`: Convert structured markdown text directly into a Word document in one call.
  3. `word_batch_add_content`: Batch-append sections, tables, and lists to existing documents in a single atomic pass.
- **Lightweight Outline Inspection:** When reading or modifying large documents, use `word_get_document_outline` first to inspect structure and headings without dumping full body text into the context window.

## 3. Package Scope & Isolation Boundary

The distribution boundary between the PyPI package and the repository is strictly defined:

- **PyPI Package (`luiccian-word-mcp`):** Bundles **exclusively** the runtime code located in [`src/word_mcp/`](file://src/word_mcp/), accompanied by `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `pyproject.toml`.
- **Repository Scope:** Test suites (`tests/`), automation scripts (`scripts/`), agent skills (`skills/`), documentation manuals (`docs/`), and GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/`) belong solely to repository infrastructure and are explicitly excluded from the PyPI wheel and sdist distributions via Hatchling build targets.

---

## 4. Official Naming & Hierarchy Standards

To guarantee consistency, cleanliness, and maintainability across the project:

### 1. Root & Module Hierarchy
- **Source Module:** Python source resides strictly in `src/word_mcp/`.
- **Package Name on PyPI:** `luiccian-word-mcp`.
- **Command-line Script:** `luiccian-word-mcp` is registered in `pyproject.toml` and points to `word_mcp.__main__:main`.
- **Support Folders (Lowercase):**
  - `docs/` (technical documentation and tool specifications)
  - `scripts/` (release, versioning, and build automation)
  - `skills/` (modular skills for LLMs: `word-document-creator`, `word-document-editor`, `word-document-security`)
  - `tests/` (automated test suites)
  - `.github/` (CI/CD and security workflows)

### 2. Python Code Standards (PEP 8)
- **Module & File Names:** Strictly `snake_case.py` (e.g., `batch.py`, `document_tools.py`, `response_models.py`). Never use PascalCase or camelCase for `.py` files.
- **Classes:** `PascalCase` (`DocumentContext`, `HeadingResult`).
- **Functions & Variables:** `snake_case` (`build_document()`, `style_preset`).
- **Constants:** `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (`DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`, `MAX_TABLE_ROWS`).
- **Automation Scripts:** Strictly `kebab-case.py` in `scripts/` (e.g., `bump-version.py`, `extract-release-notes.py`).

## 5. Optimization of Minutes and Compute in GitHub Actions

To preserve compute quotas and prevent unnecessary runner execution in GitHub Actions:

1. **Exclusion of Non-executable Files (`paths-ignore`):**
   - Workflows (`ci.yml`, `codeql.yml`) must ignore changes that exclusively touch documentation (`**.md`, `docs/**`, `skills/**`), licensing, or git metadata (`.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`).
2. **Mandatory Use of `[skip ci]`:**
   - In commits that are strictly documentary, markdown-related, or metadata refinements that do not affect runtime Python code or tests, always include `[skip ci]` or `[ci skip]` in the commit message.
3. **Automatic Cancellation of Stale Runs (`concurrency`):**
   - Workflows must maintain `concurrency: cancel-in-progress: true` to immediately terminate superseded jobs when new commits are pushed to the same branch.

---

## 6. Semantic Versioning & CHANGELOG Maintenance

1. **SemVer 2.0.0 & Keep a Changelog:**
   - Adhere strictly to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) and [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).
   - Valid changelog subsections: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`.
2. **Unreleased Section (`[Unreleased]`):**
   - Active developments not yet published with a git tag must be recorded under `## [Unreleased]`.
3. **Atomic 1-Click Releases:**
   - Do not perform manual version tagging or ad-hoc PyPI publishing. Use the automated workflow `.github/workflows/bump-and-release.yml` with `scripts/bump-version.py` to atomically bump version in `pyproject.toml`, promote changelog notes, create the git tag `v*`, and deploy to PyPI via Trusted Publishing OIDC.
